Certainly! Here are step-by-step instructions for a beginner to use the image encryption code:

Setup:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.
Open a command prompt or terminal.
Install required libraries by typing:
Copypip install Pillow numpy



Create the script:

Open a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
Copy and paste the provided code into a new file.
Save the file as image_encryption.py in a location you can easily access.


Prepare your image:

Choose an image you want to encrypt.
Note down the full path to this image.


Run the script:

In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved image_encryption.py.
Type python image_encryption.py and press Enter.


Using the tool:

You'll see a prompt: "Enter 'e' to encrypt, 'd' to decrypt, or 'q' to quit:"

Type 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption and press Enter.


Enter the full path to your input image when prompted.
Enter the full path where you want to save the output image.
For the key, enter a series of numbers separated by spaces (e.g., "123 45 67 89").


Encrypting an image:

Choose 'e' when prompted.
Enter the path to your original image.
Enter a path for the encrypted image (use a different name from the original).
Enter your chosen key.
The program will create an encrypted version of your image.


Decrypting an image:

Choose 'd' when prompted.
Enter the path to your encrypted image.
Enter a path for the decrypted image.
Enter the same key you used for encryption.
The program will recover your original image.


Quitting the program:

Type 'q' when prompted to exit the program.
